# ZigBee
Simulation of network topologies of the zigbee standard in Riverbed Modeler 17.5 (Opnet)

In this project, an analysis will be performed on a ZigBee network, which corresponds to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Through 
the use of Riverbed Modeler Academic Edition (formerly OPNET Modeler) software, a Wireless Network in the ZigBee standard will 
be simulated and verified as such a network behaves in different network configurations. And so in its result, collect several 
types of statistics that will allow us to compare the functionality, efficiency and performance of the wireless 
network in different situations.

Folder contents:
TopologiesZigbee.project - zigbee network with the same trajectory for nodes.
TopologiesZigbeeApproximation.project - zigbee network with trajectory that approximates the final devices and routers of the coordinator.
TopologiesZigbeeDistances.project - zigbee network with trajectory that moves the final devices and routers of the coordinator.
